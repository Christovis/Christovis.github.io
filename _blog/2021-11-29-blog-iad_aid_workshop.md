Information and communications technology (ICT) has played an important role in promoting the transition of society, technology, and economy from the industrial to information era. Now, the transformation of society from a information to a post-anthropocenic epoch through ICT is being widely advocated [[1]](#1), and they are often positioned as one potential means of reducing energy-intensity of daily live [[2]](#2). Reason being is, that ICT can increase the energy efficiency of the global economy, which currently wastes appr. 86% of the produced energy [[3]](#3). For the energy sector specifically, it would enable a distributed and decentralised energy networks of producers, consuming, and prosumers. This would in turn shorten power transmission routes, decrease energy waste, and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

However, the ICT sector itself will pose as a significant burden on the path towards a sustainable society while it dominates the economy and our daily lives. The worst case scenario forecasts a usage of as much as 51% of global electricity production and a contribution of up to 23% to the globally released GHG emissions by ICT in 2030 [[3]](#3).

Therefore it is necessary to critically examine separate parts of the Internet, such as its architecture and protocols, and ask not only whether they can be improved with respect to increasing capacity and speed, but also, whether they can minimise environmental damage, which has received far less attention [[2]](#2).

As the IETF is developing and standardising Internet protocols, it plays an important role in this critical examination. A clear example of IETF's influence is given by its redesign of the IPv4 communication protocol into the improved version IPv6. The redesign does not only solve the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion, but also reduces energy waste and increases flexibility towards green networking (e.g., [[2]](#2), [[3]](#3), [[4]](#4), [[5]](#5)). In 2010, the IETF set out to create a framework that enables monitoring, controlling, and managing the energy consumption of networking and network-attached devices while still providing sufficient performance to meet service level objectives with the Energy Management (EMAN) working group [[6]](#6). Five years later however, the EMAN working group was shut down and has never been reactivated despite remaining limitations (e.g., it does not address questions regarding electricity producers, and distributors) and the roll-out of new technologies (e.g., IoT and 5G). But other dimensions through which impacts on climate and ecology can be addressed are present in other working groups that are concerned with, e.g., smart energy, smart grid, and the Internet of Things.

The IETF is one of the main Internet governance bodies and it is therefore pressing to ask what its role ought to be, can be, and currently is with respect to climate change.


Now, the ICT sector is in a similar situations and various 'ICT for Sustainability' ([ICT4S](https://conf.researchr.org/series/ict4s)) and Green IT initiatives have cropped up over the years. Thus

And here, it is worthwhile to dwell on the what this space 'elsewhere' is. However, the observation that decreasing a processes resource intensity does not lead to a decrease in overall consumption, has already been described by Stanley Jevons in his 1865 work "The Coal Question". The so called "Jevons paradox" has since then always gone alongside the pursued to increasing efficiency and economic growth. Taking LEDs as an example, 'elsewhere' has come to be a very large space indeed. Their appr. 60% lower environmental impact than fluorescent luminaire [[2]](#2), and more so their impression of 'advanced technology', has motivated application to allsorts, e.g., [digital pregnancy tests](https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1301707401024827392).
