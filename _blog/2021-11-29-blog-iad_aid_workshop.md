The markets for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices are undergoing an explosive growth. It is being fuelled by a move towards distributed and decentralised energy networks (small-scale conglomerates in which energy production happens at or near consumers) that takes the existence of an Internet of Everything (networks connecting people, process, data, and things) as its premise. In the worst-case scenario, this could lead to a usage of as much as 51% of global electricity and contribute up to 23% of the globally released greenhouse gas emissions by ICT in 2030 [[1]](#1). Thus, although the ICT sector is enabling better environmental performance elsewhere, itself will take on a significant burden.

Therefore it is necessary to critically examine separate parts of the Internet, such as,
- Architecture: caching, replication, locality, asynchrony, speed,
- Protocols: format, overhead, speed,
- Formats: verbosity, compressability,
- Parameters: timers, negotiation,
and ask not only whether they can be improved with respect to increasing capacity and speed, but also, whether they can minimise environmental damage, which has received far less attention [[2]](#2).

As the IETF is developing and standardising Internet protocols, it plays an important role in this critical examination. A clear example of IETF's influence is given by its redesign of the IPv4 communication protocol into the improved version IPv6. The redesign does not only solve the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion, but also reduces energy waste and increases flexibility towards green networking (e.g., [[2]](#2), [[3]](#3), [[4]](#4), [[5]](#5)). In 2010, the IETF set out to create a framework that enables monitoring, controlling, and managing the energy consumption of networking and network-attached devices while still providing sufficient performance to meet service level objectives with the Energy Management (EMAN) working group [[6]](#6). Five years later however, the EMAN working group was shut down and has never been reactivated despite remaining limitations (e.g., it does not address questions regarding electricity producers, and distributors) and the roll-out of new technologies (e.g., IoT and 5G). But other dimensions through which impacts on climate and ecology can be addressed are present in other working groups that are concerned with, e.g., smart energy, smart grid, and the Internet of Things.

The IETF is one of the main Internet governance bodies and it is therefore pressing to ask what its role ought to be, can be, and currently is with respect to climate change.
