**Hello,**
I am a PhD candidate of the <a href="http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/">ICC/Durham</a>, and ricipient of the <a href="https://ddis.physics.dur.ac.uk/">STFC/CDT</a> studentship. I am supervised by <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=shpd91">Baojiu Li</a> and <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=lpcb73">Richard Massey</a> and work together with numerous people within and outside of Durham.

My primary research is to understand the late time accelerated expansion of the universe which we infer from multiple independent observations. I do so by running and analysing large agent-based simulations which consist of over 1 billion particles and span 13 billion years of cosmic evolution. These simulations are completed on 10,000+ core supercomputers.

My secondary interest is to grapple with the intricate ethical questions that arise once the methods I usually apply to natural phenomena, are used to study society and its members.

The programming languages I am most familiar with are listed below:

1. Python:
    - with speed ups via Numba or C and C++ through ctypes and cython
    - machine learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow
3. FORTRAN
4. Matlab

I am currently exploring new programming paradigms and concepts with
1. Scala
2. Julia

I regularly use the following technologies:

1. Latex
2. git
3. slurm & lsf batch system
4. Jupyter notebooks
5. Travis
6. PyPI, conda, pytest

I also have a strong understanding of the scientific stack, SciPy
(including numpy, matplotlib, and pandas). I utilise these tools everyday to
handle big data produced by cosmological simulations of the universe.

**Less is more..**
