**Hello,**
I am a PhD candidate of the <a href="http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/">ICC/Durham</a>, and ricipient of the <a href="https://ddis.physics.dur.ac.uk/">STFC/CDT</a> studentship. I am supervised by <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=shpd91">Baojiu Li</a> and <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=lpcb73">Richard Massey</a> and work together with numerous people within and outside of Durham. My main research interests is to understand the late time accelerated expansion of the universe which we infer from observation data of the cosmic microwave background, supernovae, Cefeids, etc. I furthermore explore the connection between galaxies and their dark matter halos through interpretable machine learning techniques.

My day-to-day activities involve running and analysing large particle-based
simulations which consist of over 1 billion particles and span 13 billion years
of cosmic evolution. These simulations are completed on 10,000+ core supercomputers.

The programming languages I am most familiar with are listed below:

1. Python, with speed ups via Numba or C and C++ through ctypes and cython
2. FORTRAN
3. Matlab

I am currently exploring new programming paradigms and concepts with
1. Scala
2. Julia

I regularly use the following technologies:

1. Latex
2. git
3. slurm & lsf batch system
4. Jupyter notebooks
5. Travis
6. PyPI, conda, pytest

I also have a strong understanding of the scientific stack, SciPy
(including numpy, matplotlib, and pandas). I utilise these tools everyday to
handle big data produced by cosmological simulations of the universe.

**Less is more..**
