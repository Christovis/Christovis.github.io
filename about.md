**Hello,**
I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/idas/">Institute for Data Science</a> and the <a href="http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/">Institute for Computational Cosmology</a>, and ricipient of the <a href="https://ddis.physics.dur.ac.uk/">STFC/CDT</a> studentship. I am supervised by <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=shpd91">Baojiu Li</a> and <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=lpcb73">Richard Massey</a> and work together with numerous people around the world.

My PhD research covers a wide range of different topics ranging from gravitational strong lensing, halo-galaxy connection, second-order CMB perturbations, and modified gravity. The underlying motivation is to understand the enigmatic late time accelerated expansion of the universe which we infer from multiple independent observations. To test new theories and potential observational probes I design, develop, run and analyse cosmological simulations which consist of over 1 billion particles and span 13 billion years of cosmic evolution. These simulations are completed on 10,000+ core supercomputers.

As the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, I joined the "Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic" (RAMP) Royal Society initiative to work with two Durham based initiatives to model its spread. One of the outcomes was the open-source framework <a href="https://github.com/IDAS-Durham/JUNE">JUNE</a>. During this effort my attention was ever more drawn to grasp the social, ethical, political, and philosphical implications of my work on how they are reflected in the current state of technology regulation.

In that pursuit I organize(d) and moderate(d) a series of conversation at the <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/researchmethodscentre/">Durham Research Methods Centre</a> on machine learning and how to foster interdisciplinary research between the humanities, social- and natural-science (blog posts on these conversation can be found in my <a href="https://christovis.github.io//essay">essay</a> section). Furthermore am I collaborating with the <a href="https://data-activism.net/">Datactive</a> group to investigate how norms, such as human rights, get inscribed, resisted, and subverted in the Internet infrastructure through its transnational governance.


The programming languages I am most familiar with are listed below:

1. Python:
    - with speed ups via Numba or C and C++ through ctypes and cython
    - machine learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow
3. FORTRAN
4. Matlab

I am currently exploring new programming paradigms and concepts with
1. Scala
2. Julia

I regularly use the following technologies:

1. Latex
2. git
3. slurm & lsf batch system
4. Jupyter notebooks
5. Travis
6. PyPI, conda, pytest

I also have a strong understanding of the scientific stack, SciPy
(including numpy, matplotlib, and pandas). I utilise these tools everyday to
handle big data produced by cosmological simulations of the universe.
