**Hello,**
I am a PostDoc at the <a href="https://ibed.uva.nl/">Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics</a> and the <a href="https://ias.uva.nl/">Institute for Advanced Study</a> where I help to set up the <a href="https://polder.center/">POLDER Center</a> for policy decision-support and evidence-based reasoning.

As part of a interdisciplinary group, I am working on new methodologies:
- Starting with the creation of conceptual models in the form of causal loop diagrams (CLD) that store qualitative expert knowledge which has been gathered through group model building (GMB).
- Turning the conceptual model, represented through the CLD, into a computational model, represented though a system dynamics models (SDM).
- The created SDM can then be further refined by replacing links with more complex computational methods, such as agent-based models (ABM).

These will be developed in the context of the energy transition in the Netherlands through the <a href="https://ias.uva.nl/research/coupled-human-and-natural-systems/future-of-energy/future-of-energy.html">Future of Energy</a> network and various governmental and industrial partners.

Previously, I was at the <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/idas/">Institute for Data Science</a> and the <a href="http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/">Institute for Computational Cosmology</a>, where I obtained my Phd under the supervision of <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=shpd91">Baojiu Li</a> and <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=lpcb73">Richard Massey</a>. This work was made possible through the <a href="https://ddis.physics.dur.ac.uk/">STFC/CDT</a> scholarship.

My PhD research covered a wide range of different topics ranging from gravitational strong lensing, halo-galaxy connection, second-order CMB perturbations, and modified gravity. The underlying motivation is to understand the enigmatic late time accelerated expansion of the universe which we infer from multiple independent observations. To test new theories and potential observational probes I designed, developed, run and analysed cosmological simulations which consisted of over 1 billion particles and span 13 billion years of cosmic evolution. These simulations were completed on 10,000+ core supercomputers.

As the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, I joined the "Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic" (RAMP) Royal Society initiative and worked with two Durham based initiatives to model its spread. One of the outcomes was the open-source framework <a href="https://github.com/IDAS-Durham/JUNE">JUNE</a>. During this effort my attention was ever more drawn to grasp the social, ethical, political, and philosphical implications of my work on how they are reflected in the current state of technology regulation.

In that pursuit I organized and moderated a series of conversation at the <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/researchmethodscentre/">Durham Research Methods Centre</a> on machine learning and how to foster interdisciplinary research between the humanities, social- and natural-science (blog posts on these conversation can be found in my <a href="https://christovis.github.io//essay">essay</a> section). Furthermore am I working with the <a href="https://in-sight.it/">In-SIGHT</a> project (formerly the <a href="https://data-activism.net/">Datactive</a> project) to investigate how norms, such as human rights, get inscribed, resisted, and subverted in the Internet infrastructure through its transnational governance.


The programming languages I am most familiar with are listed below:

1. Python:
    - with speed ups via Numba or C and C++ through ctypes and cython
    - machine learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow
2. Julia
3. FORTRAN
4. Bash
5. Matlab
6. C/C++

I am currently exploring new programming paradigms and concepts with
1. Scala

I regularly use the following technologies:

1. Latex
2. git
3. slurm & lsf batch system
4. Jupyter notebooks
5. Travis
6. PyPI, conda, pytest

I also have a strong understanding of the scientific stack, SciPy
(including numpy, matplotlib, and pandas). I utilise these tools everyday to
handle big data produced by cosmological simulations of the universe.
