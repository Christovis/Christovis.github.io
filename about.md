**Hello,**
I am a PhD candidate of the <a href="http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/">ICC/Durham</a>,
and ricipient of the <a href="https://ddis.physics.dur.ac.uk/">STFC/CDT</a>
studentship. I am working together with <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=shpd91">Baojiu Li</a> and <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=lpcb73">Richard Massey</a>. My main research interests are based around the present accelerated
expansion of the universe. I currently focuse on f(R) gravity theories and study
their strong lensing signatures.


**Less is more..**
