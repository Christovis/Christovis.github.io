**Hello,**
I am a PhD candidate of the <a href="http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/">ICC/Durham</a>,
and ricipient of the <a href="https://ddis.physics.dur.ac.uk/">STFC/CDT</a>
studentship. I am working together with <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=shpd91">Baojiu Li</a> and <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=lpcb73">Richard Massey</a>. My main research interests are based around the present accelerated
expansion of the universe. I currently focuse on f(R) gravity theories and study
their strong lensing signatures.

My day-to-day activities involve running and analysing large particle-based
simulations which consist of over 1 billion particles and span 13 billion years
of cosmic evolution. These simulations are completed on 10,000+ core supercomputers.

The programming languages I am most familiar with are listed below:

1. Python (with speed ups via: Numba, cython, and ctypes)
2. FORTRAN
3. C
4. C++

I am also familiar and can work with with the following languages:

1. Scala
2. Julia

I regularly use the following technologies:

1. Latex
2. git
3. slurm & lsf batch system
4. Jupyter notebooks
5. Travis
6. PyPI, conde, pytest

I also have a strong understanding of the scientific stack, SciPy
(including numpy, matplotlib, and pandas). I utilise these tools everyday to
handle big data produced by cosmological simulations of the universe.

**Less is more..**
