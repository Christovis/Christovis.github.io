I was invited give a lessons for two classes at the [Liceo Scientifico Galileo Galilei in Trento](https://www.lsgalilei.org) on one concepts in statistics of my choice. I decided to introduce the 'Law of Large Numbers' as it plays such an important role in mathematical modelling. But maybe more interestingly for young students, it is what the 'Kruskal Count' magic trick is based on.
