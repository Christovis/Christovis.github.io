My colleague [C. L. Cuesta](https://www.dur.ac.uk/directory/profile/?id=16714) has presented our joint work at this years [Mock conference](https://www.uibk.ac.at/congress/mockinnsbruck/) in Innsbruck.

### Abstract

We use the state-of-the-art cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical IllustrisTNG (TNG) simulations to explore the galaxy-halo connection as inferred from gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT). With the large 300 Mpc (TNG300) volume, we establish the mean occupancy of central and satellite galaxies and their dependence on the properties of the dark matter haloes hosting them. 19 halo properties. Through the interpretable machine learning approach, we can achieve two things. Firstly, the generation of an optimal model to populate dark-matter only simulations with galaxies that reproduce the observed clustering. Secondly, understand what effect each of the 19 halo properties has on the physics of galaxy formation. Through bagging and boosting we find the optimal tree depth and obtain the uncertainties predicting for each halo.
