In this research project, I am teaming up with the DATACTIVE project, led by [Stefania Milan](https://www.stefaniamilan.net/) from the University of Amsterdam and many others, and contribute to the creation of the software tool, [BigBang](https://datactive.github.io/bigbang/). BigBang can access and download public mailing archives of regulatory bodies such as [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/), [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/), [W3C](https://www.w3.org/), and [3GPP](https://www.3gpp.org/) to name but a few. It furthermore facilitates the analysis of the mailing lists to study co-production and competitive processes, affiliations and social networks, their centrality and influence, the emergence and resolution of conflicts.

This project is motivated by the fact, that discussions about norms and regulations of the Internet are all too often limited to what is visible: search engines, advertisement, and social media platforms. This, however, is only the tip of the iceberg. Beneath it, "Infrastructure sets the invisible rules that determine the spaces of our everyday life", as the social geographer Keller Easterling writes. "Changes in the globalizing world are not written in the language of law and diplomacy, but rather in the language of infrastructure." Thus this project exists to analyze the conversations and power dynamics that create information infrastructures and thus form the backbone of information societies.

Results of this project have already been accepted by high impact publishers and journals (see, e.g., [[1]](#1) and [[2]](#2)).
