The aim of BigBang is to make the production of digital infrastructures more transparent and more accountable by showing who is participating, who are making the decisions, and who are left out. BigBang examines Internet Governance and Open Source Software projects through mailinglist analysis and other tools that are used to make Internet infrastructure decisions, such as standards documents and version control systems, such as GitHub. 

Technically, BigBang enables the quantitative and qualitative analysis through statistical, discourse, and networks analysis based on a Python framework - implemented with Jupyter notebooks to make the tool transparent, editable, and usable for advanced users as well as researchers who have never used quantitative methods. BigBang has been used in several courses and Winter Schools to introduce social scientists to data analysis.

‘Infrastructure sets the invisible rules that govern the spaces of our everyday lives’, writes the social geographer Keller Easterling, ‘changes to the globalising world are being written, not in the language of law and diplomacy, but rather in the language of infrastructure’. The software project BigBang exists to analyse the conversations and power dynamics that produce information infrastructures that form the backbones of information societies.

Discussions about norms and regulations for the Internet are all too often limited to what is visible on the Internet: search engines, advertisements, and social media platforms. These media are, however, only the tip of the iceberg. The infrastructure that shapes and enables everything that happens on top, often remains undiscussed, or is even heralded as an ‘engine of innovation’ or ‘distributed architecture’.

To critically investigate the Internet infrastructure it is crucial to understand the bodies and processes through which the Internet architecture is governed and produced, specifically to understand the actors, their backgrounds, their interests, and how they deal with conflict and contestation in this process.

BigBang allows for the analysis of processes of co-production and contestation, to analyze actors and their affiliations, to understand networks of actors, analyze their effectiveness and centrality, but also to analyze which words cause conflict or people and concepts that are structurally left out. This contributes to strong power analysis that enables advocates, researchers, and citizens to hold these governance bodies and corporate actors to account.

BigBang already has an active community of both users and developers. The project has a Code of Conduct, regular calls and code-sprints in which the production of code, the development of relevant research questions and the analysis of data play equal roles. The community consists of academics and civil society activist and has been supported in the past with small donations from the University of Amsterdam, ARTICLE19, and the Centre for Democracy and Technology. The BigBang tools has already been used in a wide range of publications, served as an educational tool, and informed several advocacy campaigns.
