Hosted by the [Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED)](https://ibed.uva.nl/) and as member of the [Future of Energy](https://ias.uva.nl/research/coupled-human-and-natural-systems/future-of-energy/future-of-energy.html) network and the [Institute of Advanced Study (IAS)](https://ias.uva.nl/), I am working together with a highly interdisciplinary group towards finding optimal pathways for the energy transition. In order to face such 'wicked problem' an understanding of the complex interdependence of entities is required in order to, e.g., pace up a much needed societal transition and increase resilience. To that length, the IAS is developing a methodology to support decision making with evidence-based reasoning named: [POLicy Decision-support and Evidence-based Reasoning (POLDER)](https://polder.center/). It brings researchers and policymakers together to explore new avenues of intervention in a process of co-creation while utilizing system dynamics and complexity science methods in order to create actionable insights.

I will be focusing on the design, formalisation, coordination, and evaluation of a digital twin, a multiplex network that mimics the dynamics of internal relations in the context of external drivers and the implementation in a computer simulation model for multiple case studies. This will happen in an iterative process together with stakeholders with the aim to: i) improve the model, or ii) to design interventions for pacing up the energy transition. The computer simulations is then used to iteratively predict the efficacy of interventions, evaluate these, and design new interventions.
