title: Messy Human
---

<section>
<p>
Most professional websites don’t show what anthropologists like to call
“messy humans”. This page leans into the messiness and the work in progress
of my research, thinking, and writing.
</p>

<p>
Following the example of my friend Hans de Zwart, lecturer at the Amsterdam
University of Applied Science and co-founder of the Racism and Technology
Center, I am using this page to keep a running list of what I am reading,
listening to, and thinking about. The plan is to update it haphazardly,
share first drafts and half-baked thoughts.
</p>

<p>
I will expand beyond my stomping ground of tech and human rights to include
other aspects of my life, including anthropology et al.,
grant-making & philanthropy, parenting & childrens’ books, poetry & graphic
novels.
</p>

<p>
Like a good geriatric millennial, I do not own a tv or a subscription to any
video streaming services, but I am a fan of podcasts and mailinglist and will
include my favorites here (see below).
</p>

<p>
I am unsure who might be interested in this information, but thank you for making
it all the way to this page and feel free to drop me a line if you have any
recommendations, thoughts, comments, or concerns about being human or this messy
page.
