**Note:** This is part of a draft for a longer article on the narrative shaped by the digital industry.

Governance, especially in a state of emergency, has immensely improved since numbers, indicators, categorisations, and comparisons have been utilised in the second cholera pandemic in the first half of the nineteenth-century [[1]](#1). Quantification gives a basis on which change can be understood, risk calculated, and actions defined. Since then, the reliance on data-driven reasoning has intensified through two important events. Firstly, neoliberal policies of the '80s have completed the dismantling of public and private monopolies over telecommunications networks and digital technologies [[2]](#2). It permitted corporate interests to control the narrative about data-driven reasoning. Secondly, the breakthroughs in machine intelligence in the 90's exemplified by the victory of Deep Blue winning against Garry Kasparov. These events have transformed data into the new oil of the digital economy which is sold through the impression of a "speedy, accessible, revealing, panoramic, prophetic, smart, specific, side-effects-free" algorithm ([[3]](#3), [[4]](#4)). Today, the PWC 2020 [report](https://www.pwc.es/es/auditoria/assets/global-top-100-companies-2020.pdf) shows that those organisations form the largest sector in global market capitalisation. Like no other occupation, data scientists define "the pathway to the future" and thus "they must take a leading part in [ensuring] that the new world [...] is a good sort of a place in which to live" as was written in the MIT Technology Review of January 1932.

While recent innovations have indeed led to some societal benefits, they have also demonstrated their potential to be abused or misused in ways their designers could not have imagined [[5]](#5). To understand how this mishandling was possible, it is essential to understand the environment in which data-driven solutions were designed. The organisational culture in which they were developed is strikingly homogeneous social and political positions, that is marked by a lack of diversity and unwillingness to embrace pluralism ([[6]](#6), [[7]](#7), [[8]](#8)). This culture has been found to navigate rather than resolve the ethical minefield that a business model of informational capitalism faces [[9]](#9).
