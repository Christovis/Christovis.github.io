**Note:** This is part of a draft for a longer article on the narrative shaped by the digital industry.

Governance, especially in a state of emergency, has immensely improved since numbers, indicators, categorisations, and comparisons have been utilised in the second cholera pandemic in the first half of the nineteenth-century ([[1]](#1)). Quantification gives a basis on which change can be understood, risk calculated, and actions defined. Since then, the reliance on data-driven reasoning has intensified through two important events. Firstly, neoliberal policies of the '80s have completed the dismantling of public and private monopolies over telecommunications networks and digital technologies ([[2]](#2)). It permitted corporate interests to control the narrative about data-driven reasoning. Secondly, the breakthroughs in machine intelligence in the 90's exemplified by the victory of Deep Blue winning against Garry Kasparov. These events have transformed data into the new oil of the digital economy which is sold through the impression of a "speedy, accessible, revealing, panoramic, prophetic, smart, specific, side-effects-free" algorithm ([[3]](#3), [[4]](#4)). While recent innovations have led to some societal benefits, they have also demonstrated their potential to be abused or misused in ways their designers could not have imagined ([[5]](#5)).

This narrative has predominantly been created by white male researchers with technical education background ([[6]](#6)). They have build a organisational culture with homogeneous social and political positions, that is marked by a lack of diversity and unwillingness to embrace pluralism ([[7]](#7), [[8]](#8)). Today, the PWC global market capitalisation [report](https://www.pwc.es/es/auditoria/assets/global-top-100-companies-2020.pdf) shows they lead the largest sector in the global capitalisation. Hence, "the pathway to the future is in the hands of the engineer" and thus they "must take a leading part in seeing to it that the new world which [they are] creating is a good sort of a place in which to live" as stated in the MIT Technology Review of January 1932.
