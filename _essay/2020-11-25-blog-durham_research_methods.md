## ML in Durham
Machine Learning (ML) has, in the last decade become something of a scientific bandwagon. Starting as a theoretical work in the departments of computer science and mathematics, it has since toured through most campus parts of many universities in the world, with many gigs having led to new insights and breakthroughs on a wide range of topics. Durham University, being proud of having one of the leading music departments in the UK [^1], is hosting leading scientists in their field which add their compositions to this trend helping to improve our understanding of both their field and ML itself. Examples are in Psychology, where [Ulrik Beierholm](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile/?id=14641) is using reinforcement learning to model how the nervous system deals with uncertainty. Although ML methods are infamous for being black boxes, when it comes to Neuroscience they are still easier to study than a brain. In the department of Archaeology, [Michelle W. De-Gruchy](https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/staff/?id=8883) applies ML to map soil types on aerial photography or satellite imagery. These are just two examples of ...


## Pitfalls
"As a consequence, it has perhaps been ballooned to an importance beyond" its
actual capabilities [[1]](#1).
[Data shift and underspecification](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/18/1012234/training-machine-learning-broken-real-world-heath-nlp-computer-vision/). Data shift describes the mismatch between the data the ML was trained and tested on and the data it encounters in the real world. This problem is almost ubiquitous in all ML applications and something social scientists are very familiar with as we have learned in our previous [conversation of the replication crisis](https://researchmethodsconversations.blogspot.com/2020/10/research-methods-conversations.html)

## Responsibility
[Alexandra Cristea](https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/directory/staff/?id=17167) is working on ethics in ML. [Noura Al Moubayed](https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/directory/staff/?id=14675) is currently working on explainability of ML in the department of CS. [Michelle W. De-Gruchy](https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/staff/?id=8883) remote sensing of soil maps mapping.

Work on machine learning shifts from a knowledge-driven approach to a data-driven approach.  Scientists begin creating programs for computers to analyze large amounts of data and draw conclusions — or “learn” — from the results. the term “data driven” to refer to machine and deep learning models, whereas “knowledge driven” will refer to constraint-based models.

## How to
Starting your your own dive into ML is substantially easier with knowledge of Python,
as 99% is done in python with libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, thus skills
in this language are essential (Jonathan Frawley gives a course on it).

There is also the option of creating a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competition
for you scientific problem.
