## ML in Durham
Machine Learning (ML) has, in the last decade become something of a scientific
bandwagon. In many cases, it was able to improve performances compared to classical
approaches, leading to breakthroughs.

The University of Durham hosts a number of researches who jumped on the bandwagon.
Gigs are performed by
[Ulrik Beierholm](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile/?id=14641) (Department of Psychology) is using reinforcement learning to model how the nervous system deals with uncertainty. [Michelle W. De-Gruchy](https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/staff/?id=8883) applies machine learning to map soil types on aerial photography or satellite imagery. To just name a few examples.


## Pitfalls
"As a consequence, it has perhaps been ballooned to an importance beyond" its
actual capabilities [[1]](#1).
[Data shift and underspecification](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/18/1012234/training-machine-learning-broken-real-world-heath-nlp-computer-vision/). Data shift describes the mismatch between the data the ML was trained and tested on and the data it encounters in the real world. This problem is almost ubiquitous in all ML applications and something social scientists are very familiar with as we have learned in our previous [conversation of the replication crisis](https://researchmethodsconversations.blogspot.com/2020/10/research-methods-conversations.html)

[Harsh Bajpai](https://www.dur.ac.uk/directory/profile/?id=19043)
investigates surveillance in digitalization of learning in classroom environments
(pupils, teachers, administrators,...) [Surveillance on students raise privacy concerns on Online Education Platforms](https://www.theleaflet.in/surveillance-on-students-raise-privacy-concerns-on-online-education-platforms/#).


## Responsibility
[Alexandra Cristea](https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/directory/staff/?id=17167) is working on ethics in ML. [Noura Al Moubayed](https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/directory/staff/?id=14675) is currently working on explainability of ML in the department of CS. [Michelle W. De-Gruchy](https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/staff/?id=8883) remote sensing of soil maps mapping.


## How to
Starting your your own dive into ML is substantially easier with knowledge of Python,
as 99% is done in python with libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, thus skills
in this language are essential (Jonathan Frawley gives a course on it).

There is also the option of creating a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competition
for you scientific problem.
